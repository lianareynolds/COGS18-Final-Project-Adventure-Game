    "   In DimensionalAdventure, you, the curious and brave person sitting behind the keyboard, will embark on an adventure to\n",

    "\n",
    "   I chose a choose-your-own-adventure game from the suggested list of ideas because it sounded like a really fun way to learn how to code on my own with a goal in mind, without any guidance from a class. I'm also a writer and adore creativity, so I was immediately drawn to this!\n",
    "   \n",
    "   I started by drawing out a decision tree in plain old english to create a small narrative and visualize the paths I would later code. This really helped me as I was coding, because whenever I felt like I didn't know what to do next, I just looked back to my decision tree and had a next step to take, which really reduced my anxiety.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   I ended up using 5 functions to create my game. I know that's more than required, but I wanted to make a good narrative and make the adventure fun for you! \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Each function includes a while loop and if, elif, and else statements to account for inputs from the users. The hardest thing for me was nesting all of this and creating loops that ran effectively in the narrative, so if you got stuck you could restart and take different branches without any bugs (there were a ton at first).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Ultimately, in this choose-your-own-adventure game, you're taken from earth to another dimension, facing pirates and difficult decisions along the way. I hope you enjoy!\n",
    "   \n",
    "   P.S. Thank you to all the wonderful TA's who helped me so much this quarter and to Professor Ellis for making sure this course wasn't overwhelming for beginners like me!\n"
